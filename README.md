# Flappy-Bird-Game
This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Flappy Bird game using Java. Developed as a solo project, the game features intuitive controls where players navigate a bird through obstacles by tapping the screen or pressing the spacebar. Leveraging object-oriented programming principles and graphical user interface (GUI) components, this project serves as a learning exercise in game development and Java programming. Explore the code to understand the game mechanics and feel free to contribute or provide feedback for further enhancements. Enjoy playing Flappy Bird!
